It wasn’t enough to send my kids to school.  It wasn’t even enough to feed a family.  So I found an agency that helps you find jobs overseas.  They taught me to work in other peoples’ homes: how to cook, how to clean, things like that.  On the day that I left Indonesia, my children were four and six.  I brought them to my sister’s house.  I explained I had to go to work.  Just ‘go to work.’  That’s all I said.  I’ve been gone now for almost twenty-five years.  I could only visit my children every two years, when I was given a vacation.  But I did provide for them.  I sent all my money to my sister.  I paid for their school.  And they did well.  They are both in pharmacy school now.  But recently they’ve told me how much I hurt them.  They’re older now and I guess they think I can take it.  They told me how everyone else had a mom.  And how hard it was for them.  I always wonder what life would have been like if my husband hadn’t died.  Sometimes I blame myself.  I left my children.  What kind of mother leaves her children?  I still have one year on my contract, but after that I want to go back to Indonesia.  I’ve grown old already.  I hope I can become closer to my kids.  I have two grandchildren now.  I want to know them.  I just hope I can make it better.”",

So I overworked myself in every possible way.  I tried to qualify for scholarships every year.  I did little side jobs, and volunteer work, and lots of extracurricular activities.  I actually enjoyed being so busy, even though it was exhausting.  It made me feel alive.  Like I was growing.  And building myself.  And moving forward.  I felt like I wasn’t a loser in the race.  I was keeping toward the front.  But the whole time my body was deteriorating.  It started with being tired all the time.  Then I began to lose weight.  Then little illnesses: a cold, the flu, digestive problems.  I was carrying pills with me all the time.  Then last year I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  It was curable, and the surgery went well, but for the first time I was forced to think about dying.  I always thought I wasn’t afraid of death.  But before my surgery, I was scared.  I realized  that I didn’t want to die.  I’m too young to die.  So I right now I’m taking a break from life.  I just want to get healthy.  I’ve moved back in with my parents, and my plan this year is to have no plan.  No obligations.  No self-improvement.  Nothing.  It hasn’t been completely peaceful.  There are moments when I feel anxious.  Like I’m standing still.  And the world is going on without me.  And everyone else is doing something: studying, earning money, building a career.  But I’m not.  I’m just here.”",

One kid brought in an umbilical cord from his mother, and everyone was freaking out, but she didn’t even care.  I used to think that art was like drawing a person and it had to look perfect.

But she refuses to remember the hard times.  And it’s extremely frustrating.  Both my parents were always so stuck in their own stories.  Their own problems.  It was never about me.  I know that sounds selfish-- but children are selfish.  You have to be selfish to survive.  I was never acknowledged.  Never encouraged.  Never had the feeling they were proud.  They didn’t even show up to my graduation.  It took me so long to get over that shit.  It took me so long to feel worthy.  And now, all these years later, my mother’s story is this:  ‘I did everything for you, I sacrificed everything, and your childhood was beautiful.’  She says it in a way that implies I should be thankful.  And grateful.  And what’s most triggering-- she says it in a way that implies I should pay her back.”",

I was his youngest daughter.  Both my siblings were twenty years older, so I was his little girl.  And I don’t think he could let go.  We’d argue all the time.  But he just wanted to protect me from everything bad that could happen.  When I was in high school, even if I came home from a party at 3AM—he’d be awake in the living room.  I’d hear the TV turn off as soon as I walked in.  And even after I moved out, he’d always call to see if I was OK.  Actually he’d make my mom call.  Because he was too proud to do it himself.  Mom would make small talk for a few minutes, then she’d always say: ‘Your dad wants to ask you something.’  I remember one time his voice was breaking on the phone.  He just kept pausing, and asking when I’d be coming home again.  I think he already knew about the cancer.  We discovered it so late.  By then we only had about three months left.  It was hard to see him get so weak.  He’d been strong his entire life. He’d been working since the age of fourteen.  Never for himself.  He never spent his own money.  It was all for us.  Eventually it got to the point where he could only lay on his bed.  He was so sleepy from the chemo.  But even then he kept trying to protect me.  He would just keep saying: ‘I’ll be fine.  Don’t worry about me at all.  I don’t want you to worry.’”",

I had five siblings, and we weren’t exposed much to the outside world.  But there was one teacher who helped us.  Her name was Utie, and she had a passion for helping refugees.  She volunteered to tutor us for free.  Even though we only saw her two or three times a month, she gave me another perspective on life.  I’d probably have five children by now if it wasn’t for her.  She taught me to think critically about our traditions.  She had empathy for our culture, but she also taught me that not all traditions are positive.  Especially for women.  She wanted me to be an individual.  To be self-assured and confident.  And to develop my own goals and dreams.  I don’t want it to seem like my life was so difficult before, and now I’m so modern.

From Grandpa.’  But my addiction was stronger than the gift.  And I spent it on food.  I kept a little trash can hidden in my closet.  I’d use it five or six times a day.  It was always about control.  I couldn’t control much in my life, but I could control this.  I had the power to make people worry about me.  I had the power to make the numbers go down.  Eventually my parents stopped keeping food at home.  They put a lock on the fridge.  My whole day was structured around food.  I tracked everything I ate.  And at some point in the day it would feel like too much, so I’d throw it up.  I felt disgusting.  I felt like people could smell it from a mile away.  So I kept to myself.  And what do you do when you’re all alone, and you don’t have anything, and you want a little pleasure?  You eat.  Then you throw up.  It was so hard to stop.  If it had been as easy as chopping off my hand, I would have done it.  But it’s not like cigarettes or alcohol.  You can’t just kick food out of your life.  You have to confront it.  You have to get back to normal.  Even now it’s inside of me.  I know I’m still vulnerable, especially during my low points.  But it’s not my life anymore.  It started with single days.  Nights where I’d lie in bed and realize I hadn’t thrown up.  Then weeks would go by.  I’d have major fallbacks, but by then I’d tasted normalcy, and I wanted more of it.  You miss so much of life with your face in a toilet.  So I’d start over again.  Now I have things in my life more powerful than the addiction.  Recently I told my dad about the 50 Euro bill, and how I’d spent it, and how guilty I felt.  He told me not to worry, and gave me this new one.  It’s not the same.  But this time I’m going to keep it.”",

But the problem with ideologies is they try to supply an answer for everything.  They become a building of thoughts and rules—the key to every human problem.  And if you possess the key to everything, every last answer, then it becomes a right—even more than that-- a duty, to bring other people to your viewpoint.

I never realized I could be a liar.  But I made up so many stories.  I even hid it from my friends.  It always seemed like a temporary love story.

I wrote a letter to a German writer who was known to be politically connected.  I told him our entire story, and asked for help.  He wrote back right before Christmas.

But I’m in the middle of the ocean, and there’s no land around, and no markers, and everything looks the same.  And I’m just flailing.  I haven’t spoken to my mother for over a year.  She says I’ve had too many chances.  She wants me to finally quit the drugs.  And I can’t promise her that.  She says it’s my choice, of course.  I can keep doing them if I want.  Just without her.”"

I’ve been struggling with chronic depression, and I think the most obvious symptom is negativity.  My perception changed so slowly that I didn’t even notice.  It didn’t feel abnormal.  I just thought I was seeing the world clearly.  I thought people were basically mean.  I couldn’t find the energy to sit down with them, talk to them, and learn they aren’t bad.  But watching her grow has been a revelation.  She’s positive toward all humans.  And everyone is positive toward her.  I never know who starts it.  I don’t see who begins the interaction.  But so many times I’ll be on the bus or metro, and I’ll look up, and she’ll be smiling at a stranger.  And they’re smiling back.  And it makes me so happy.  Sometimes my face hurts from smiling so much.  She’s taught me how prejudiced I’d become toward other people.  Somehow I’d forgotten that if you smile, people smile back.”"

They gave me whatever I wanted: toys, dresses, horse riding lessons.  They completely spoiled me.  But all of them are very conservative.

It’s always: ‘When are you coming back to Hungary?’, and ‘Did you get a boyfriend yet?’  When they were young life was very difficult without a man.  All of them got married around the age of eighteen.  So they think I’m running out of time.  They’re obsessed with me meeting someone, and they always have the perfect person in mind: nice boy, tall, curly hair, great family.  They’ve introduced me to five boys already.  The last time was an ambush.  I was home on holiday, and they told me a ‘special someone’ would be joining us for Sunday lunch.  He was ‘studying to be a lawyer,’ and ‘so very handsome’ ---which turned out to be a bit of an exaggeration.  It was so awkward.  They sat him right next to me.  They kept saying: ‘Isn’t she so pretty?  Can you believe she’s never had a boyfriend?’  And whenever there was silence, they’d say: ‘You have this in common, so you should talk about that.’  This went on for two hours.  His face was so red the entire time.  After he left, I set a rule: no more introductions.  Never, ever again.”"

He’d been working to break up a child pornography ring, but suddenly the case was closed by his bosses.  The order had come from the mayor.  He was so upset that the case had been squashed that he mailed us some of the evidence.  We received two black-and-white stills from a surveillance camera.  They featured a man.  We knew that his name was Robert, he lived in the south of Holland, and he operated by feeding hungry kids in order to abuse and film them.  We searched all over for Robert.  We showed the photos to all our sources connected with these networks. And after months of searching, we finally discovered him living just a few kilometers from my house.  We rang his doorbell, told him some bullshit story, and got inside.  There were piles of VHS tapes everywhere.  We waited until he went to the bathroom and grabbed as many as we could.  They contained all the horrible things you could imagine.  We called Robert in to our offices, showed him the tapes, and he started pointing fingers at other people.  A giant ring was uncovered.  And one of the people that Robert accused was named Mr. Norbert.  We discovered him in one of the videos.  He was only visible in four or five frames.  And do you know who he was?  The brother of the Belgian mayor who squashed the original investigation.”",

Especially a white guy.  It’s not even possible to have an Islamic wedding with a non-Muslim.  But he’s made it clear that he’s not willing to convert.  And I understand his position.  We were just talking about our future yesterday.  I know the situation bothers him.  He wants me to commit.  He wants me to be clear, and say that none of this matters, and that I’m willing to lose everything to be together.  But it’s not that easy.  My uncles would turn away from me.  My aunts would turn away from me.  I’ve seen it happen to other members of my extended family.  I’d like to think that my mom would never leave my side-- but she’s a people pleaser, so I can’t be sure.  My father divorced her.  And she’s been carrying that shame all her life.  So I’m not sure if she can handle any more.  Right now I feel like I’m living two lives.  I went home for Eid and it felt like I was living a lie.  I’m not sure what to do.  I know he thinks I’m doubting our relationship.  But it’s not like that at all.  I wouldn’t have invested this much time if I didn’t want to be together.  And I’m willing to do it.  I’m willing to tell the whole world, and my family, and have them never speak to me again.  But in the back of my mind, I can’t help asking myself: ‘Why won’t he convert?  Just for a minute.  He doesn’t have to follow.  But that way I can tell everyone that we’re Muslims.  Why am I the one that has to make the sacrifice?’”",

Then one day I was standing next to a cute girl at a bus stop, and I googled: ‘How to approach women.’  That’s when I came across a forum for pick-up artists.  It’s exactly what I’d been looking for.  It seemed like a cure for my autism.  I watched all the videos I could find.  I started working out at a gym.  I’d spend all day approaching women.  Soon I was only hanging out with other pick-up artists.  They respected me.  They wanted to learn from me.  Finally there was something I was good at.  Right now I have over one thousand numbers in my phone.  It’s a bit like gambling.  Sometimes it goes well.  Sometimes it doesn’t.  But you always have the chance for sex.  There are so many tricks to learn.  Women have emotional brains.  They get addicted to feelings.  You can use that to your advantage.  The first time you meet her—tell her she looks amazing.  But never give her a full compliment again.  She’ll always chase that validation.  It’s like a drug.  Tell her ‘she looks beautiful for her age.’  Tell her ‘she looks good in this lighting.’  Keep her insecure with half compliments.  Keep her feeling like there’s something wrong with her.  Like she’s not good enough for you.  Like she needs sex for validation.  Of course it’s manipulation, but why should I care?  I’ve been manipulated so many times in my life.”"

But if I perceive consciousness to be an illusion, then surely I must exist.  These questions give me so much anxiety.  I can’t stop thinking about them.  I’m not attentive when other people speak to me.  I forget to clean my room.  I don’t do my homework.  I can’t learn my lines in drama class.  It creates so many problems in my life.  My parents tell me: ‘You could win this award.’  Or: ‘You could easily make these grades.  But you don’t care enough.’  They’ve taken me to ten psychologists.  Never a diagnosis.  They just say that I’m a dreamer.  And in this world dreamer is not good.  Dreamer means child.  I need to become an adult and do material things.  So that I’m stable.  So that I can buy a house one day.  So that I’m not just living beneath a bridge—thinking these thoughts.  But it’s so hard to find the energy.  Before I begin I must know if life is absurd.  I can’t live in an illusion.  I want to be lucid.  I need to know that I’m doing things for a reason.  That I’m expending energy for a reason.  If death is the end of all this-- and nothing but emptiness after that-- then it’s a terrible problem.  It would be better to not exist than to exist in a world without meaning.”",

And she never understood why I felt so restless.  I was never allowed to go out with friends.  I wasn’t allowed to go to shopping malls.  So I became a timid person.  At school I was always the student who was ‘just there.’  I’d sit in the back of the class.  I wouldn’t answer questions.  One of my teachers asked me when I’d joined the class and I’d been there for two years.  But I always loved learning.  I wanted to be a teacher.  I just never thought I had the courage.  I didn’t think I could stand in front of a class.  I didn’t think I could control the kids.  So I kept giving up.  I dropped the course two times.  But my friends kept encouraging me, and I finally got my certificate in July.  Since then I’ve been on nine interviews.  I’ve had three placements already.  Two were at Catholic schools— which especially worried me because I’m so visibly Muslim.  But the students were great.  The teachers were great.  And I’ve grown so much.  I can stand my ground.

He drove me to the wedding in the same car that he’d driven my mum— a green MG Midget.  He walked me down the aisle.  He gave a speech at the reception.  There was no focus on being ill.  Or why we moved the wedding.  It was just a nice speech.  I have a film of it, but I haven’t watched it yet.  I think it might be too sad.  Dad passed away five months later.  My husband and I had a vow renewal recently.  It was exactly one year from the planned date of our original wedding.  We held it at the same museum.  It was the original guest list.  There was a lot of soul searching involved.  We weren’t sure if it was the right thing to do.  We weren’t sure if people would understand-- especially because it happened to fall on my dad’s birthday.  But it turned out lovely.  Really lovely.

It was a very high wall, and the whole way down I’m thinking: ‘Shit this is going to be cold.’  But as soon as I hit the water, I got my mind on the job.  I swam 50 yards until I reached the man.  By that time he was unconscious, but I pulled him toward the shore.  A police boat arrived and hauled us out with ropes.  They took me to the station, filed a report, gave me some old clothes, and sent me on my way.    There were no newspaper articles.  No interviews.  I told nobody except for my boss, because I had to explain why I was late for my 2:45 meeting.  But I did get one little thing.  Hanging in my home, at the top of the staircase, there’s a certificate from the police commissioner.  It says: ‘Gallantry Award: Rescued A Drowning Man From The River Thames.”",

I’d lock doors.  I’d take her money.  I’d hide keys.  But she’d do anything to escape.  She withdrew from so many rehab facilities.  I grew so depressed that my psychiatrist recommended a meditation retreat in the countryside.  One thing they taught us is that suffering comes from our attachments.

When he got a little older we’d do little plays together.  Snow White.  Peter Pan.  We even printed little paper tickets.  It was almost like I was part of the family.  But Dan got a little older and didn’t have as much time.  And that’s OK.  I’ve grown a lot.  I know that if Dan doesn’t talk to me for a few weeks because he’s traveling, he’s still my friend.  I’m strong enough to know that.  He’ll always care about me.  He’s just like his dad that way.  Even when he was a little kid, and I’d call the house, Dan would never say: ‘Here’s my Dad.’  He’d always sit there and talk to me.  He knows how to slow down my brain when I’m overwhelmed and everything comes out too fast.  Last night we went to see a Broadway musical.  I gave him all the birthday presents I’ve been saving since February.  And today we’re going for high tea so we can sit in the air conditioning and talk about our memories.  Dan has a fiancée now, and he’s so busy, and recently I’ve been thinking that he probably doesn’t have time for me anymore.  And that maybe I shouldn’t call so much.  But he never seems to mind.  He always takes the time.  Just like Ed.  Sometimes I’ll just call him to say I just want to tell you that I love you.”",

He lost his father too.  So he knew what it was like.  He’d want me to use my coping skills.  He would want me to be healthy.  And to live the best life possible like he’s still here.

But Ed gave me a big hug, and told me: ‘That’s not going to happen to you because you’re strong.  You’re stronger than that.’  And I think that’s when  he changed from my teacher to my friend.  He brought me home to meet his family.  He became almost like a second father to me.  Whenever I had a meltdown-- my mom would reach out to Ed.  He could always read my mind.  He’d tell me: ‘I know what’s wrong.  Prom is coming up in two weeks and you’re really nervous.’  But other times Ed would be tough on me because he knew that I could handle it.  Whenever my feelings got hurt, he’d let me cry it out.  But then he’d sit me down and say: ‘You’re stronger than this.  Don’t let them get a reaction out of you.’  Together we started a club for neurodiverse people called The Aktion Club, and Ed asked me to be the president.  He knew that I had leadership skills.  It was hard when I graduated high school because I stopped seeing Ed every day.  It made me a little sad that I couldn’t see him all the time but I knew that he was really busy because he had a family.  And there were so many other students he had to help.  But we still talked on the phone.  And we met once a week for dinner at Riviera Pizza.  I’m not sure what my life would have been like without him.

I have no ability to predict the future.  I told everyone that beforehand. There’s no invisible hand moving the cards.  There’s no spirit whispering secrets in my ear.  But I do believe in the cards.  I believe in them like you’d believe in a poem.  I believe in their aesthetics.  I worked with French cards.  Very old cards.  Each card was beautiful, but when you arranged them on the table, they would speak to each other.  They’d relate to each other.  They became metaphors.  I’d merely ask each person to look at the cards and describe what they’re seeing.  Everyone brought their own lives to the table.  Their own memories.  Some people left thinking they’d gotten a prediction. Some left thinking they’d gotten advice.  Some left with specific ideas: the title of a song, the conclusion of a novel, I never knew.  Because everyone brought their own needs to the cards.  Just as we bring them to every encounter.  Just as we’d bring them to a poem.”",

I’ll never see myself as retired.  Right now I’m trying to become a fiction writer.  I love it because my brain is always working.  Some days I think about my work so much, that when I finally sit down to write, it just comes pouring out my fingers.  I’d love to finish a book one day.  Something that people enjoy.  And I’d love to have it published.  Maybe a hardcover from Random House.  That gets optioned for a movie.  And wins an Oscar.  Oh it’s exciting, isn’t it?  I could go on and on.”",

She’s the light that shined upon my darkness.  She taught me so much.  When she gets pissed off, or sad, she just deals with it alone.  She’s strong like that.  She doesn’t project it on other people like I did.  She’s the first person that made me sit down and think about how I affect the people around me.  We’ve been together for seven years now.  We make music together.  And I’m in a much better place.  If I’m feeling negative energy, I just put it into our music.

I sometimes view myself from the outside—like I’m dealing with things in the third person.  It’s been like that since childhood.  I’ve always come across as cold.  People tell me that I was a little shit as a kid.   My family called me ‘King’ because I’d have anger fits and always get what I want.  But even with these difficulties I did well in school.  I was able to graduate college.  And now things are going well.  I have a good job.  I have no housing issues or major stresses.  But still I feel so negative all the time.   And I don’t want to be this person.  I’m not actually cold.  I’m just stuck in a mindset.  I’m not focused on being kind because of unaddressed issues.  My mom was in and out of my life as a kid.  She had bipolar and maybe schizophrenia.  She’d whisper to herself.  She’d scream in public.  She’d disappear for months a time.  Last week I went to her funeral.  Everyone was crying but I’m so detached from things that it barely affected me.  I didn’t even tell my close friends.  All of us hung out after she died, and I didn’t say a thing.  Because people tend to back away when you share.  It’s not a criticism against them.  I’d do the same thing.”",

No matter how hard I tried, I could never reach past a B.  I even got a tutor in high school, and she was great, but my grades didn’t really improve.  I was intimidated by how well other students could write and speak.  I didn’t think I’d ever reach that level.  I figured that college just wasn’t for me.  After graduation I took a year off and backpacked through Southeast Asia.  I loved it so much.  I didn’t want to leave.  When I came home I decided to major in history, because at least I could keep learning about Asia.  I’m almost finished now.  I made it through with about a ‘B’ average.  Last term I even got nominated for an award by my favorite professor.  His name is Arne Kislenko.  He’s a little bit of a hard ass.  He expects a lot.  He doesn’t even post lecture slides.  But he has stories and tidbits for everything.  Even though I almost failed his class, I registered for two more because I learned so much.  I wrote my final paper on Thai Foreign Policy from 1932 to 1945.   He handed it back with a note that said: ‘See me.’  He told me that he was nominating me for the Dean’s List Essay Award.  I was the only student he chose.  I didn’t win, but I didn’t care.  It showed me what I could do if I write about a subject I care about.  It was the first time I’d ever been recognized for something academic, and it came from the smartest person I know.\"",

Just bothering me.  And I sorta went blind with rage.  I didn’t actually hit him, but I grabbed him aggressively.  Then I started hitting the desk, and yelling about how I hate myself, and how all I do is annoy people, and how I know that everyone hates me.  I felt so much shame afterwards.  I was disgusted with myself.  I used to have so many emotional problems when I was younger.  I’d yell.  I’d cry.  I’d throw tables and chairs.  But none of that had happened since primary school.  I made a promise to myself.  No more outbursts.  The incident happened on Friday, so I was able to go straight home.  All weekend I thought about suicide.  On Monday they called me into the office, and I confessed everything.  I told them I was in a bad place.  They sent me to the hospital for a few days.  When I came back to school, a lot of kids approached me in the hall.  They told me they were worried.  And they hoped I got better.  I just kept saying ‘I’m fine, I’m fine.’  But one girl told me that she'd cried during cheerleading practice.  And that shook me a little bit.  I laughed it off at first, but later I started thinking about it.  It’s easy to say ‘get better.’  But I never thought someone could actually cry for me.”",

That’s when I decided to create the first dog shelter in Tehran.  I ran it alone for fourteen years.  I had to buy the food, pay the salaries-- nobody would help.  Many people in Islam think that dogs are unclean.  It was very difficult.  At the time I owned a shop selling tires, and half of my income went to the shelter.  I grew very depressed.  Our shelter could only handle one hundred dogs, but 10,000 were being killed every year.  It wore me down.  I didn’t have the energy for it.  Two years ago I handed off the shelter to a brave young girl, and I moved to Canada.  I’m working as a barber now.  But I still send money to the shelter.

Either I stop needing to be the best, or I’ll die of a heart attack when I’m 40.”",

So I decided to be an English major like her.  Ten years later I’m working as a copywriter at an advertising agency.  You know that feeling when you’re pulling into the driveway, but you can’t remember anything about your ride home?  That’s a bit how it feels.  Like I blinked and I’m eight years down a career path that I just sort of fell into.  There’s plenty to be grateful for.  It’s a good enough job.  I’m not living paycheck to paycheck.  I can afford to have fun and take vacations.  But my job is not my passion.  And every story you see elevated on social media is: ‘I loved this thing.  It became my passion.  And then it became my career.’  There’s not many people saying: ‘My job isn’t my passion, but I love mountain biking on the weekends.  And that’s enough for me.’  I think the feeling I’m trying to resolve is a sense of ‘enoughness.’ There’s so much I love about my life, but I spend most of my time at work.  Is it OK to get my joy outside of work?  Or does my passion need to be tied to my livelihood and a sense of responsibility?”",

We had an eight month old daughter.  He loved that little girl so much.  You could tell by the way he looked at her.  Absolute adoration.  We always used to argue over who’d get to bathe her.  He was the one who put her to sleep that night.  I remember he came downstairs and told me that he’d said ‘goodbye’ to the baby.  I said: ‘You mean “goodnight,’ not ‘goodbye.’  Then he told me that he loved me.  And we both went to bed— I thought.  The next morning I found him in the garage.  It looked like he was just standing there.  My neighbor said I screamed like a wounded animal.  My God I was traumatized.  I never slept another night in that house.  It was two years before I could sleep at all.  I dropped from a size twelve to a size six.  At the time I fucking hated his guts.  I mean c’mon, this baby wasn’t an accident.  We committed to this.  Our daughter needed him.  And it was all so humiliating.  Everyone knew that my husband had hung himself in my garage.  Apparently I was so insignificant as a human being-- so abhorrent, that my own husband felt the need to take his own life.  My privacy was gone.  There was no front stage and back stage anymore.  Everyone knew the worst thing about me.  And I figured that if I could handle that, I could handle anything.  I transformed myself.  I became more courageous.  More extroverted.  I went back to university and got my Masters.  Now I work as an expert witness in custody cases.  I think that two people died on that day.  Blair, and the woman who was terrified to live without him.”",

Everyone around me was talking about love, and being in love, so I wanted to experience it myself.  I met him at an audition.  Both of us wanted to be in films.  He was thirty-eight: tall, very attractive, and working as a stuntman.  He wanted to spend all his time with me.  I thought I was in love.  But after several months of living together, I began to realize that it wasn’t meant to be.  But the more I withdrew-- the more controlling he became.  He went everywhere with me.  He’d lock me in the house.  Whenever he left town he’d take away my documents.  And he warned me that if I ever left, he’d go back to my hometown and make a scandal.  Reputation was something back then.  So I was terrified.  When nothing else worked, he would beat me.  He was proud of it.  He’d smile when someone noticed my bruises.  For three years I lived like this.  I came to believe that the only way to free myself was to kill him.  But I didn’t want to go to jail, so instead I became very sweet and compliant.  I convinced him that I loved him.  And that I was happy with our life.  So he became less guarded, and one day while he was at work, I took a taxi and escaped.  From then on I started looking out for myself.  I became cold and detached.   I promised myself that I’d never fall in love again.  And that if someone fell in love with me-- I’d use them.  And that’s why I’m a bitch.”"

Everyone wondered: ‘Why not Italy?’  So I asked myself: ‘What can I do with a lunar sample?’  And then I had an idea.

Five of my professors had Nobel Prizes.  If you didn’t have a Nobel Prize, you were nothing.  These men were like gods to me, and suddenly we were eating in the same cafeteria.  I decided to focus my efforts on an apparatus called a mass spectrometer, which allowed me to individuate atoms and molecules in the vapor phase.  And my experiments were very successful.  We were discovering new molecules and some of them were quite interesting.  They were resistant to high temperatures.  The US government became very curious about my molecules.

So when I was given the opportunity to come to Spain, I knew I had to take it.  But the day that I left was horrible.  I’d never been outside of Ecuador.  I’d never been apart from my mother.  Both of us were crying like children at the airport.  I had no idea what I’d find when I arrived.  My plan was to make a little money, come home, and start a business—maybe a food stand.  Just a little something to make our lives easier.  Soon after arriving in Spain, I found work cooking and cleaning at a summer camp.  It was in the mountains.  It was very isolated.  But they were kind to me.  They gave me extra jobs and allowed me to stay during the offseason.  It was very lonely, but I spoke to my mother every day.  And I was able to send home almost all the money I made.  After seven years I received my residency papers, and I was finally able to go home for a visit.  I’d wanted to surprise my mom, but she has high blood pressure—so I told her I was coming.  She was standing in the doorway when I arrived.  She held me for the longest time.  Everything had changed.  The house had been empty when I left.  Now there was furniture: chairs, sofas, two beds instead of one.  A new stove.  A fridge full of food.  A television—not even one with knobs.  It had a real remote.  We stayed up all night talking.  I told her all about Spain.  Eventually I was able to bring her here.  We live together now.  I see her every day.  And I’m working as a home health aide.  So if anything happens, I can take care of her.”"

A crowd had gathered.  And that’s when I decided to leave.  I explained to my son that I’d be home soon.  Then I crossed the border into Colombia and took a flight to Spain.  I’ve been here for a year now.  I live in a flat with four other refugees.  I’m making enough as a bike messenger to send home $100 every two weeks.  It’s enough to buy them food and medicine and anything else they need.  My son always asks when I’ll be home, and I just keep saying ‘soon.’  And even though I’m lonely, I’m much calmer now.  Because at least I know they’re eating.  The plan has always been to bring them here, but the problem is passports.  The government has stopped giving passports.  We applied five months ago but nothing happened.  So three weeks ago I gave $600 to a man in government.  He promised to help.

We arranged a meeting, and he showed up like he was interviewing for a job.  Very well dressed.  Very clean.  Very polite.  ‘I’m extremely focused on getting my doctorate right now,’ he said.  ‘You probably won’t even notice me.’  So I selected him.  The first week was fine.  The second week he brought a girl over.  The third week he brought two girls over-- and they were in the shower all night.  I was beginning to get annoyed, but I hoped things would get better.  Then the next week I worked a late shift, and arrived home one night to loud music playing.  I thought maybe he had a few friends over.  I went straight to my bedroom and changed into my pajamas.  I wanted a quick snack before bed, so I went to the kitchen, and that’s when I noticed dust all over the counter.  It was arranged into lines.  So naturally I cleaned it up.  That’s when I heard people yelling at me.  I turned around and saw twenty people in the living room.  Nobody was wearing clothes.  It was a big mess of white, pink, black, and brown.  Lots of skin.  Lots of hair.  There was kissing and touching.  Lots of groaning.  I’d never seen anyone naked before.  I went to an all-girls Catholic school.  My roommate walked up to me, tried to take my hand, and said: ‘Join us.’  Instead I rushed out the door, down the stairs, and ran through the streets in my pajamas.”",

He told me: ‘Anything you need, I’ll give you.’  And for a few moments I felt protected from the troubles of life.  His home was like a prison, but I cannot say that the prison was uncomfortable.  He told me not to worry about residency papers.  He said that he’d talk to his lawyers and everything would be arranged.  But time went on and the papers never arrived.  Whenever I questioned him, he’d change the subject.  Then he started to say: ‘I won’t do it.  Because if you have papers, you’ll leave me.’   I was trapped.  I couldn’t work.  I didn’t have a bank account.  I didn’t speak the language.  Over the years I became like a child.  All I ever said was ‘thank you’ and ‘I’m sorry.’  He convinced me not to trust anyone.  I could see on TV that French people had friends, and went to the office, and took vacations.  But it was like a different world.  There were years of my life when my only human contact was with my dentist.  I lost hope.  You can’t live in pain all the time.  You have to give up.  So I just focused on survival.  I couldn’t leave because my son would have no life back in Moldova.  He was the only thing I loved.  Eventually he turned eighteen and got his official papers.  Then he wrote a letter explaining my situation.  He sent it to some ministry-- I don’t know.  He didn’t even tell me about it.

And one day he asked me to stay after class.  I was sure he wanted to talk about my poor grades, but instead he told me that he recognized my enthusiasm.  He said that he understood my difficulties.  And he promised I could overcome them with reading.  He gave me a list of books, and he suggested we read them together.  Every day we’d meet during lunch and discuss what we’d read the night before.  I wanted to impress him so I always read more than he expected.  When we got to the end of the list, he started letting me choose the books.  I finally learned what it meant to ‘escape’ into a book.  My writing got better.  My speaking got better.

I just needed to process what happened.  But then I kept going back, back, writing everything I could remember: the walks we had together, the places we visited, museums, castles, holidays with the children.  I carried a pen with me at all times.  Every time I had a memory, I’d write it down.  We’d known each other since we were fourteen years old.  We’d take walks in this park back then—with our parents permission, of course.  It’s been almost nine months since his death.  I’m feeling a little better.  I’m still writing, but it’s not so much about memories anymore.  It’s more spiritual now.  I think he's still evolving somewhere.  One night I saw him in a dream.  It was the young Claude.  Twenty-five or thirty years old.  It was so real.  I don’t even think it was a dream.  I could feel him there.  He was standing in a doorway, dressed completely in red.  And Claude never wore red.  But when I reached out to hug him, the door closed, and he disappeared.  I believe he's still out there somewhere.  And that I’ll see him again on the other side of that door.”",

I left my hotel with the cash in my pocket, had a few drinks, met a woman, and woke up in an alley.  Don’t remember much.  Even my ID was gone.  I’ve been here ever since.  There’s nothing left for me back home.  The divorce was finalized in May.  The money’s gone.  I’ve got nothing waiting for me but debts.  This isn’t my first time in Paris.  I’ve been here one hundred times before--  but always on the other side of the wall.  The good side: nice hotels, nice restaurants, plenty of money in the pocket.  Now I’m seeing all the shit.  All the crap.  The alleyways are filled with young men who should be defending their own homes and families and countries—but now they’re here and they don’t give a shit about anybody.  Three times my clothes have been stolen right next to me.  Sometimes when I’m awake.  They don’t say ‘please.’  I’m stressed as hell.  I’m not sleeping.  Last month I had a heart attack right in front of the hospital.  Everyone turned away when I asked for help.  They could tell that I’m a street person.

I was a twenty-four year old interpreter at the time, and they assigned me to the president of the skydiving union.  His name was Michel.  He was a retired soldier from France.  He’d been part of The Resistance, and still had a number tattooed on his arm from his time in a concentration camp.  We spent four days together.  Nothing romantic happened, but there was something forbidden about it.  He was forty years older than me.  We’d walk arm-in-arm.  He was dignified.  He was fascinating.  He was charming.  And after he went home, we began exchanging letters.  It became a beautiful friendship.  It lasted for years.  But my husband didn’t like it, so eventually I stopped responding.  Michel wrote a few more times but eventually gave up.  I never gave him an explanation.  Recently I discovered the letters while cleaning my room.  I decided to look him up on the Internet, but all I found was his obituary. He died four years ago.  He was eighty-eight.  Right now I’m on a journey through France, collecting information on his life.  I found some military records already.  Today I’m going to call his wife and ask for an interview.  I want to put everything into a book—a tribute of sorts.  I don’t know what I’m looking for.  It’s just something I feel like I have to do.  I want to end the story.”"

I’d make all the decisions—even the difficult ones.  He lived in the past.  He’d bring up fights he had during his childhood.  And he was paranoid.  Mostly he was paranoid of losing me.  He’d call me his ‘soul mate.’  His ‘sunshine.’  It was all very confusing.  I was only ten years old.  The most hurtful thing was seeing him destroy himself.  He was capable of getting a job, especially when he took his medicine. But he was always drunk.  He had a lot of homeless friends that took advantage of the situation.  They’d take his money.  They’d sleep over.  And I was the one who had to kick them out.  Everything was on my shoulders.  I was losing weight.  I couldn’t concentrate at school.  Eventually I decided I couldn’t take it anymore.  One night he got so angry that I locked myself in the bathroom, and I stopped talking to him for four years.  No more worrying.  No more headaches.  I felt a bit guilty, but mostly I just felt free.  I could work on my own problems.  I could learn about myself.  I’m seventeen now, and we’ve started talking again recently.  But on my terms.  I decide when I want to see him.  It’s still complicated, but it’s easier.  Because I’ve learned to accept that my father has no interest in improving his situation.

It used to be a French colony.  There were no jobs on our island, so I came to study in Paris at the age of twelve.  Things were very difficult.  I was one of the only black students at my school.  There was a lot of racism.  One teacher especially made my life difficult.  She taught economics.  It wasn’t my best subject because I was more interested in literature, so occasionally I’d talk to my friend during class.  And the teacher failed me for ‘disrespecting her.’  She told me to go back to ‘the coconut islands.’  She said I’d never amount to anything in life.  I ended up pursuing a more artistic path.  And a few years later I became the principal dancer in a big musical.  It was a showcase of music from my island.  Many famous musicians participated.  I convinced my white friend to invite that economics teacher to the performance.  She had no clue I was involved.  When the show was over, I walked straight into the audience, found her seat, and asked: ‘Does this count as doing something with my life?’",

We never knew how much time we had left, but we knew it was limited.  We’d always been best friends.  I told her my secrets.  She gave me advice.  She cooked for me like I was still a child.  But before the cancer, things were so casual.  She was always around.  Nothing seemed important.  She was strong.  She was independent.  She didn’t seem to need attention.  But when she was given a new life--  I cherished her more.  I became nicer.  Softer.  More sensitive to her needs.  We started hugging.  We hadn’t hugged since childhood, but we started hugging.  I can be difficult sometimes.  I’m stubborn.  I don’t agree easily.  But she never had to convince me again.  I took her to restaurants, movies, weddings.  I found her artificial hair so she looked beautiful again.  I sewed her the best dresses ever.  I wanted to make her new life comfortable.  And it was.  It was the happiest she’s ever been.  Eventually the cancer came back.  It’s been over two years since she passed.  For the longest time I cried like a baby.  In the office.  In the car.  At church.  She was my best friend.  The world feels empty without her.  Even last night I dreamed about her.  But I know I must move on.  I still think about her all the time.  But now I don’t always cry.  Sometimes I smile.”"

Quite a bit taller than me.  Eventually he went on to play for the national team.  And I was so shy.  I could barely speak to her.  At the end of the year I wrote her a long letter declaring my love.  She broke up with the basketball player over the summer, and when I returned to school the following year, she’d written ‘Yes’ on my desk.  Everything changed.  The world had light and color.  There was no more rain.  We’d go walking in the town center.  We went dancing.  But when Christmas came around, she told me we needed to talk.  She was getting back together with the basketball player.  So I played all my cards.  I wrote a short story.  It was about two soldiers competing for a woman’s love.  One of them was a powerful lieutenant.  The other was a simple soldier, who loved her more and later died in battle.  When I finished I asked her to read it.  She told me it was very nice, then married the basketball player.”",

And looking back-- I don’t think I was ever a pioneer in anything I did.  I grew to realize that knowledge is a community, and my role would be to add a tiny grain of rice to the pile.  But that was still exciting for me.  Learning new things was the biggest passion of my life.  It was only frustrating when I tried to share that knowledge.  I had to accept that my passion isn’t universal, and in the end my work might only benefit a few people.  But that’s OK.  A few months ago I received a call from a teacher in Italy.  She told me that she’d read all my works.  And that she agreed with my interpretations.  And that she planned to incorporate them into her own work.

There was weighing of the food.  My father would lose his temper, but she still wouldn’t eat.  Once he got so angry that he hit her.  From the age of ten to thirteen she went to a hospital in Barcelona.  Occasionally she’d come home to visit, but mostly I only heard from her through letters.  Nobody explained to me what was going on.  They only told me she was very sick.  I didn’t even hear the word ‘anorexia’ until several years later.  Things got even worse when she came home from the hospital.  The illness was even more ingrained.  She’s twenty-five now.  There have been periods where she seems to be getting better, but it always gets worse again.  It’s taken a toll on my parents.  Both of them look like they’re in their seventies.  My mom is on antidepressants.  The therapists have told them that the disease has gone on for so long now—that it will probably be lifelong.  Whenever I try to ask my sister about it, we always argue.  She gets frustrated.  She feels attacked.  So I’ve stopped trying.  It was only two months ago that she finally admitted having a problem.  We were walking home from a family dinner, and she told me everything started when she was nine years old.  She was meeting a group of friends at the mall.  And a group of boys started making fun of her.  She had a lot of freckles back then.  And bright red hair.  And maybe she was a little bit chubby.  But just the smallest bit.”",

We’d meet at Starbucks every day and cry in front of everyone.  We didn’t live together after that.  And we were never sexual again.  But we were still intimate.  We still took a lot of naps together.  I always held her.  We’d go shopping and walk arm-in-arm.  She kept my last name and called me her gay husband.  Her health began to deteriorate in 2007.  It was a nerve disease.  She lost her hearing.  Then her sight.  And I took care of her.  She always told me to forget about her.  To go out there and find a good guy.  But I stayed by her side.  We’d never officially gotten divorced, which helped in the end.  They let me in the hospital room as her husband.

He’s the master of hugging the dog.  He’s also the master of needing attention while you’re on the phone.  Or when you just want to relax and watch TV for a second.  But it always goes from frustrating to heartwarming in a second.  Even though he can’t express himself, he’s amazingly empathetic.  He’s drawn to people who look alone.    <br> There are meltdowns.  And there are days when I feel like I’m not qualified for any of this.  But on the days you don’t think you can get through it— you don’t realize that you’re getting through it.  And in the end, you’re getting more than you ever give.  Recently my wife started sending me pictures of other children, but I always said ‘no.’  Until I saw Mile’s little sister for the first time.  She’s from the same orphanage.  Her name is Maddie.  We submitted our papers three weeks ago.”"

The next morning we went straight to the orphanage.  We sat in a waiting room on the ground floor, and after ten minutes they brought Miles around the corner.  My wife dropped to her knees and hugged him like she’d never let him go.  And of course that broke me down.  I’m thinking ‘Oh my God, this is my boy.’  But when I went to pick him up, he started crying.  I��m telling him: ‘No, no, no!  I’m Baba, I’m Baba.’  But he didn’t want me touching him.  I went from the top of the world to the darkest valley.  I tried playing with him.  I tried getting him a Happy Meal.  But he didn’t want any of it.  Nothing was going right.  I felt so rejected.  This went on for two days.  Then on the third day we were sitting in our hotel room, and my wife left us alone while she took a shower.  And all of the sudden this little boy started looking at me.

People try to scare the crap out of you about how emotionally damaged the kid will be.  The agency made us sign a contract acknowledging fourteen ways the adoption could fall through—and there weren’t any refunds.  They warned it could take two years.  And it’s so expensive-- $32,000.  But at that point Miles’ picture was hanging all over our house.  We talked about him all the time.  He was already our son, but he was sitting in an orphanage.  We needed to get him home as quickly as possible.  I took out a loan against my retirement.  I racked up so much credit card debt.  I planned on using the reward points to buy his plane ticket home.  Miles spent his second birthday at the orphanage.  We filled a box with $300 worth of presents.  It cost even more to ship.  Inside we put his very first pair of walking shoes.  Hip-hugger pants to help with his posture.  A t-shirt that said: ‘Someone in Fairfax, VA loves me.’  And Mickey Mouse party favors for all the kids at the orphanage.  Then we ordered him a cake from a local bakery.  A few weeks later, the orphanage sent us a picture from the party.”"

I would just swing on our outside swing and daydream, and while that was great and stuff-- it was pretty much like my life had ended.  When I first joined Special Olympics I was nervous because whenever we played tetherball at school, kids would sigh and say: ‘Renee!’  And that never helped.  But Special Olympics was different.  It showed me—well actually God showed me that there are people just like me.  My teammates don’t even mind my movie quotes because almost everyone has something they love.

My father would physically pull me out of the water at dinnertime.  But my village was very traditional and conservative.  Adult women weren’t allowed to swim.  So I had to quit when I turned fifteen.  I didn’t begin again until my twenties.  By that time I’d moved to the city, and there was no female instructor at our public pool.  So I volunteered.  During my lessons, I kept noticing an autistic boy who would stand along the edge and watch.  Nobody wanted to teach him.  The male coaches were afraid of being bitten and scratched.  But I could tell that he was so curious, so I began to play with him.  I splashed him.  Slowly I touched him.  I’d hold his leg and pull him through the water, teaching him how to breathe in and breathe out.  He’d climb on my back and hold my neck while I did the strokes.  He did bite me.  And hit me.  And sometimes he’d squeeze my neck too hard.  But it was never malicious.  In his mind he thought he was doing the right thing.  It took a long time—but slowly he learned how to swim.  Now he comes running to me whenever he sees me.  That experience gave me a weakness for kids with disabilities.  I’ve taught over two hundred so far.  There is no government support.  Nobody comes to see these children.  So I go to the villages and seek them out.  I teach them to swim in ponds and rivers.  When they feel happy, I feel happy. Recently I’ve started my own academy—just for them.”",

But I was never able to graduate from school.  I have dyslexia.  I’m not good at reading or writing.

Sometimes it’s not as easy for men to show emotion.  Women tend to band together.  I joined so many mom groups.  I talked through everything.  My husband is a bit of a jock, so I kept sending him videos of Down Syndrome athletes.  I wanted him to get excited about the possibilities.  We drove to the beach one weekend shortly after the diagnosis, and the entire ride we talked about the future.  We talked about how much of our daughter is going to be like any other child. And how we can still be a family.  We can still go to Disney World.  We can still have adventures.  When we arrived at the rental house, I put one of the ultrasound pictures on the fridge. That evening we were sitting on the beach, about to go back inside, when this little girl with Down Syndrome came walking up to us.  She was wearing a Minnie Mouse bathing suit. She didn’t say a word. She just stood there—smiling at us.”"

Special Olympics gave me a list of sports and I chose the long jump.  But two of my athletes couldn’t jump.  So we moved to the javelin throw.  But that was too hard to throw, so now we’re competing in the shot put competition.  When I first met Monick, she’d never really left her house before.   She couldn’t look me in the eye.  And she was afraid of the shot put.  She’d drop it on the ground every time I handed it to her.  She’d hide her hands behind her back.   But I invited her whole family out to train with us.  Everyone participated.  And that gave her confidence.  On days we weren’t training, her mother gave her coconuts and rocks to throw.  When it was time to compete, nobody knew if she’d be able to get on the plane.  She was so scared.  She was crying and clinging to me the entire flight. Once we arrived, we had to drive straight to the stadium for qualifications.  Everything was so new for her.  She’d never left her island before.  The stadium was so big and she had to go out on the field all by herself.  On her first throw she forgot everything she learned.  She dropped the shot put immediately and the referee raised a red flag for disqualification.  But then she looked back at us.  She calmed down.  She remembered being back on the island with all her family.  And she threw it so far on the second throw.  When the white flag was raised, we all went crazy.  And she won the silver medal.”",

It’s getting harder for him to copy me now that we’re adults, but the desire is still there.  He wants to drive like me.  He wants a girlfriend like me.  He wanted a job at the grocery store so badly that he cried during the interview.  He wants a family.  And a house.  And a car.  And I want him to get there too.  But I’m not sure he realizes how difficult those things will be.  There’s another level he has to get past.  Cooking is still difficult.  And washing clothes.  And counting money.

There’s no running water, no electricity, no utilities.  Certainly no special education facilities.  He came alone to our city looking for assistance.  When I first met him, his trousers were completely torn.  He was so small for his age.  I’m a special education teacher, so I said to myself: ‘I’m going to help this boy.’  He lived with me for four years.  It was the only way he could get training.  I coached him on the Special Olympics soccer team.  I tried to give him structure.  I told him: take a bath every day, go to sleep early, always go to school.  The advice had to be continuous because he forgets very easily.  But I did everything for him.  He became like my son.  But he never called me ‘father.’  Always ‘teacher.’  And I never forced him to stay.  He’d leave home for a few nights at a time, but he’d always come back.  I was really hoping he’d live with me until he got a job.  It’s dangerous for him to be on his own because he needs guidance.  His family has many bad habits.  But last October he turned eighteen, and he chose to go home.  He reaches out to me sometimes when his family runs out of food.  Or when he needs money.  He knows that I can never say ‘no.’  At first it was very difficult.  I worried nonstop.  I’d always ask his friends: ‘Where is Azril now?’  But I have to accept I’ve done all I can.  He has become an adult.  When we return from the games, I think it’s time for me to let go.”",

We led workshops with the students, asking them: ‘What excites you?’, ‘What are your challenges?’ , ‘What would you like to tell the world?’  Then we took those ideas to professional choreographers, and refined them into a performance.  We brought the results back to the students, and asked: ‘Is this your vision?  What would you change?’  When the students finally recognized the work as their own, we knew our job was finished.”"

The occasional cold chicken finger that she’d bring back from a night of partying.  I left the house when I turned twelve and started staying with school friends every night.  By thirteen I was making my own money from acting gigs and extra work.  And by sixteen I was completely on my own.  I couldn’t balance school and work so I dropped out in the ninth grade.  I worked in record stores.  I started photographing bands and then moved into photography.  That’s what I’ve been doing the last twenty years.  Lots of commercial stuff.  Lots of happy family snappies in the park.  But these last few years I’ve moved into fine art photography. And the whole ‘art thing’ really requires me to put myself out there.  It’s personal.  So I’ve had to confront my past.  I’m sensitive about my lack of education.  I don’t have a degree or the sense of entitlement that comes along with it.  Sometimes it can feel like a closed door.  Like I don’t belong.  It can be difficult to self-advocate.  Or stay confident in the face of rejection.  Or own my space when I’m dealing with someone that is difficult.  Ironically my husband and I have a lot of friends who are authors, or professors, or film directors.  They’re all very educated.  I just never had the chance.  I had to zig and zag and do whatever I could to survive.  But I got here.  I’m attending my own art show this afternoon.  And you know what?  Talking through this stuff just made me realize that I’m proud of myself.”",

He didn’t push me toward a particular career.  He just always wanted me to work toward a goal.  I made good grades in high school.  I studied chemistry in college because that was my favorite subject.  I planned on being a teacher.  Freshman year went great.  But soon the classes got more specialized and difficult.  I tried working harder, but that didn’t seem to help.  I began to feel like a failure.  My behavior changed.  I started skipping classes.  I overslept my alarm.  Some days I wouldn’t even get out of bed to eat.  If I did get out of bed, it was usually just to play video games.  My grades began to drop.  But I remained in denial for the longest time.  I didn’t think I deserved to be depressed.  I had a great childhood.  A great family.  I did well in school.  But the denial caused the depression to snowball.  Because over and over again I’d ask myself why, and I could never pinpoint the answer-- which made me even sadder.  My best friend suggested that I leave school and get a job.  He thought it would force me to get into a routine.  And he was right.  I started working at a silicone plant in Albany.  Some days I wanted to die, but it got me out of bed every day.  And that had always been the most difficult thing.  Soon I was going to the gym.  And hanging out with friends again.  It’s been six years since I left school.  I’m feeling pretty good.  I manage a liquor store now.  I work hard.  I make decent money.  Maybe going back to college is the next step, but I’m not in a hurry to find out.  Right now I’m fine with not progressing-- because I feel content where I am.  If I’m stuck, it’s definitely not a bad stuck.”"

But the instability has caused me to rethink my relationship to work.  My first job out of college—I lived and breathed work.  I managed a team.  I was always available.  I’d answer emails at midnight.  I took work calls on my wedding day.  And I never minded.  I felt like the magical cog that kept everything going, and that indispensability was a big part of my confidence.  So I took it pretty personally when I got laid off.  Dozens of people lost their job that day, but I still saw it as a personal failure.  After that I was forced to separate my identity from work.

His mother and I tried to work it out, but eventually I moved to Philadelphia.  Could I have been more present?  Yes.  But it’s not as easy as: ‘Hey, I’m going to be there no matter what.’  A lot of sacrifices are required to be present in someone’s life: unhappy relationships, no name towns, low-paying jobs.  I didn’t want to work at a mill or a warehouse my entire life.  I wanted to do something in music.  Or work in a high rise with executives.  Or form my own company.  Incremental changes weren’t going to get me there.  I had to make a big jump.  I had to leave.  And I thought he’d be OK.  There was a lot of support around him.  I’d call on the phone to check on school.  I’d come back once a month, pick him up, and go out for the day.  And the decision certainly allowed me to provide more-- especially later in life.  I work in television now.  I’ve introduced him to celebrities.  I’ve brought him to award shows.  I paid for his expensive music school.  But there are definitely some resentment and abandonment issues.  He has trouble making friends. He’d rather be playing piano than going to parties.  He’s a bit like a hermit in the mountains.  And recently he’s made some pretty deliberate comments that seem aimed at me.  Like: ‘I haven’t seen this person in awhile, so they don’t care.’  Or ‘Nobody’s going to come to my recital, so it doesn’t matter.’  These are issues that I have to resolve.  And I’m trying.  But I still can’t say I regret my decision to leave.  I think it was the correct choice.  But I also have to own that the choice probably changed him for life.”",

She was like a drill sergeant.  She told me when to wake up.  She told me when to go to sleep.  I don’t remember having interactions with her that weren’t her telling me what to do.  And if I resisted, she’d lash out physically.  She’d push me around.  She’d hit me in the face.  My only escape was reading.  After school I’d explore the stacks in the library, pick random books off the shelf, and choose anything that I found interesting.  I’d check out as many books as I could carry.  Back then you were allowed to keep them out for four weeks.  I’d read in my bedroom, in the bathroom, at the dinner table.  Books removed me from that toxic environment.  They exposed me to different worlds, different ways of thinking, different points of view.  I began to do really well in school.  I skipped grades.  On the citywide tests, I scored in the 99th percentile for vocabulary and reading comprehension.  My mother resented it all.  She’d call me an ‘educated moron.’  I went to City College at sixteen.  Graduated at nineteen.  Then after graduation, I used all my savings to travel to Paris for a month.  I explored the city.  I visited museums.  I met so many people from so many countries.  And by the time I came home, I had everything planned out: I found a job, found an apartment, and waited for my parents to visit their country home.  Then I packed up my things and left.\"",

I was the twenty-fifth.  I broke my back and neck in four places.  The driver was fleeing from the police in a stolen car.  He was twenty-one years old.  His name was Rashad.  A lot of people in my life thought he should get the death penalty.  But I never had strong feelings about it.  Maybe I disconnected from my emotions.  Maybe it’s just my personality.  But I mostly just felt sad that he’s so young and he’ll be in jail for the rest of his life.  Recently I looked up the address of his prison.  I purchased a PO Box.  And I wrote him three letters.  I’ve held onto them for months without sending them.  I guess I’m struggling with the fact that empathy is a privilege.  I’m still alive.  I’m still able to walk.  There are people who lost more than me who might be upset that I’m showing him any compassion at all.  But I find it curious that I know nothing about somebody who had such a profound impact on my life.  All three letters begin the exact same way: ‘We’ve never met, but we were in the same place at the same time.’  I’m not sure what I’m looking for.  I just figure there’s something to be said.

My mother would actually negotiate with my teachers during parent-teacher conferences.

I fell in love with punk music: Sid Vicious, Billy Idol, The Clash.  They made me dance like a crazy.  So many times I cried.  But I especially wanted to be on the stage.  So I found two guys and started a band.  We were called The Ridiculous.  For two months we played on the street outside the club.  But it was harder than I thought.  We never were invited inside.  Our drummer found another band.  Then the guitarist found another band.  And then it was just me.  That was forty years ago, but I’m still keeping the punk alive.  One day I will try again.”",

I love taking care of people.  And if I can’t conceive, I’ll adopt.  I’ve got everything figured out.  I didn’t think about it much in high school or middle school.  But now that the future is in such close proximity, motherhood has become my security blanket.  I think about it whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed.

I just knew that I was meant to perform.  Then one day a woman walked up to me in a health food store, and asked:  ‘Do you always talk like that or do you have a cold?’  I said: ‘Excuse me?’  And she told me that she wanted to cast me in a BMW commercial.  I thought it was a freebie.  But on the way out of the studio, they asked for my social security number.  $750 for three minutes on the mic!  I thought: ‘I need more of this.’  I started taking acting classes.  I got cast in a few local plays.  I moved to New York on my 50th birthday.  I wasn’t about to sit around in my later years wondering if my soul had gotten what it needs.  I drew unemployment for the first time in my life.  But by 2003 I was a member of SAG.  By 2005 I had a speaking part on Law and Order SVU.  And at the age of 62 I was given a full scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.  Things have dried up a bit since then.  I had to take care of my mother for six years.  And it’s hard for women of a certain age to get cast.  But it ain’t over yet.  Things happen when they’re supposed to happen.  And I’m a firm believer that nobody can get what is yours to have.  And I will tell you this: I’ve already envisioned what I’m wearing the first time I get invited to the Oscars.  Red mermaid dress, fitted from the waist to the knees, and flaring out at the bottom.  A stand-up collar that frames the back of my head.  Stunning neckline.

We mainly just played a lot of board games: Risk, Scrabble, Scattergories, a Trivial Pursuit game from the 1980’s-- which everyone sucked at.  But we became best friends, and the next year decided to get a house together.  That’s when things started to get tense.  We began sitting closer together.  We were touching more.  We’d play with each other’s hands.  Never holding hands-- but playing with hands.  And we’d even fall asleep in the same bed together.  There was a time that she told me goodnight, and I swear I felt her brush my lips, but by the time I opened my eyes she was out of the room.  Neither of us had ever dated a woman.  And I was terrified to try anything.  We were such good friends.  There was always this fear that if I voiced the desire, it would ruin our friendship.  But one night we were out for drinks at a hotel where Al Capone used to stay.  I was feeling pretty drunk, so I leaned over and said: ‘Sometimes I feel like I want to kiss you.’  And she replied: ‘Sometimes I do too.’  I didn’t say a thing.  I wasn’t even sure that I’d heard her correctly.  I just kept thinking: ‘Oh my God, it’s happening.  It’s happening.’  Then once we finished our drinks, and started walking home, I stopped her in front of a bridge.  I said: ‘Shall we do it here?’  It was December 12th, 2002.  And even though we got married five years ago, that’s the day we celebrate as our anniversary.”"

So I thought: ‘It’s time to dance.  You need to dance now.’  I wasn’t quite ready because I hadn’t had enough to drink.  But thankfully I’d just learned some dance moves from the movie Hitch.  Slowly I wedged myself between them.  I backed in-- butt first, using my special moves.  I didn’t even make eye contact with the guy.  Thankfully he gave up.  We danced together for about an hour.

Anyway, the one thing I’ve always wanted to do is go back to school.  Cause I promised my dad.  Then one night I was watching Billions and there’s this psychologist who always keeps the men in check.

I need a second chance.’  The deadline had already passed, but she ended up doing me a solid.  She performed some sort of alchemy on my transcripts and came out with a 2.6 GPA.

I pictured sleepovers, and nail painting, and close friends that you could share secrets with.  I imagined that once you became a sister, these things would just materialize.  But it doesn’t really work like that.  My pledge name was Eeyore.  I didn’t talk much.  I didn’t smile.  I always assumed people were thinking negative things-- about my weight, or my clothes, or my hair.  I joined the sorority to feel like part of a community, but I mainly just felt black.  One time my sisters tried to set me up with the one black guy at another fraternity.  And once I was wearing a French maid’s costume, and somebody asked if I was Aunt Jemima.  I couldn’t seem to make any close friends.  Nobody really included me in things, or opened up to me.  And I always attributed it to my race.  It’s what I always assumed.  But now I’m not so sure.  Maybe I could have been more social.  Maybe I could have made more of an effort.  People don't automatically want to spend time with you, and I wasn’t the friendliest person.  So it’s hard to tell: what was race, and what was me.”"

I was the youngest of eight children, and we split three bedrooms between us.  All of us couldn’t even fit at the kitchen table, so we had to eat breakfast in shifts.  We shared everything: school supplies, books, bicycles.  One Christmas we got a single pair of roller-skates for eight kids.  Adolescence was the most difficult.  My mother would sew our clothes from the same piece of cloth.  And I started to want a little privacy, but instead we’re sharing perfume, and shampoo, and deodorant.  But all the sharing brought us closer.  Everyone helped each other.  We had no choice.  When the oldest kids began to work, they paid for the younger ones’ studies.  All of us eventually went to college and became professionals.  When my mother passed away, she asked me to keep everyone together.  We have a WhatsApp group where we chat everyday-- even if just to say good morning and good night.  Or to discuss ways to help my Dad.  Here’s a picture of everyone at his 90th birthday.  He still lives in the same house we grew up in, but we added a second story.  There are four more rooms now.  But whenever we get together, we still have to take turns at the kitchen table.”",

    "content":"\"I’ve been dancing ever since I was a little girl.  But college seemed like the natural order of things, so I went to Michigan State and got my bachelor's degree in education.  After that I taught for five years in Detroit public schools. I enjoyed teaching. But I always knew that I wanted to be dancing full time.  On the weekends I’d perform in off-Broadway shows and little showcases. I was also dancing for the Detroit Lions.  But they didn’t even let us dance on the field.  We had our own little section in the stands.  I had friends who’d skipped college and focused entirely on dancing.  Some of them got jobs with major artists, and I started seeing them on TV.  I wanted that life.  But I knew it would require leaving Detroit.  And I just wasn’t ready. But then came the Beyoncé Formation World Tour. June 14th, 2016. Ford Field. I was sitting just above ground level-- stage right.  And there was this moment during the song ‘Freedom,’ where all the dancers were dancing in water, and it was so beautiful.  I just remember sitting down in my seat, and thinking: ‘I can do this.’ The following Monday I told my boss that I’d be moving to New York.  I’ve been here for almost a year now. I’m tutoring and teaching to pay the rent. I was hoping to have a manager or agent by now, but it’s so competitive.  I’ve been to auditions with 400 people competing for five slots.  And everyone is so talented that the distinctions become so small: your body type, what you wear, how you wear your hair.  Things can seem out of your control.  But I’ve had some success. I danced at the Ladies of Hip Hop Festival.  I’ve gotten to final callbacks for Lion King, Mean Girls, Cats, and Motown the Musical.  So I know I have the talent. I know that I’m close. It’s like a carrot dangling in front of me. This year my goal is to have one significant performance.  And my ultimate goal is to dance on a world tour.  With any major artist-- especially Beyoncé.\"",

I almost died and completely destroyed a vertebra. I slept in a hospital bed for three months. I had to learn to walk again.  Even today my back requires a lot of maintenance.  It’s like an engine without oil. It grinds. It flares up. I actually just finished getting X-rays because it’s been a bad week.  But I take a lot of pride in how independent I’ve become despite the disability. Much more so than before the injury. I finally left Long Island and moved to the city. I’ve taken my health into my own hands, which is huge for me.  I have doctor appointments every day this week-- but in a good way. I’m being proactive about my health. I can’t do high impact exercises, but I’m weightlifting a lot. And I’m traveling. Next month I’m going to Sri Lanka and India.  The sixteen-hour plane ride is going to be brutal, but it’s important for me. I don’t want to have any barriers. A couple years ago I went on a five day trek in Patagonia.  It was completely off the grid.  Just me, my sister, and my map.  My mother was terrified. It was my first major travel since the accident. And there’s no satellite reception, so if you hurt yourself, you’re done. But I was determined. I didn’t want my sister to leave me behind.  So I exercised every day for six weeks. I bought some hiking sticks and supportive shoes.  I carried 60 lbs of supplies on my back. Each day we hiked eight miles. I brought five pieces of chocolate-- one for each day we finished. At night I’d rest my back. The last day was the hardest. We covered sixteen miles and climbed the highest summit. I kept trying to talk myself out of it. I was stopping every 50 feet.  I told my sister to keep going, but she stayed with me. And we finally got to the top. It wasn’t very cinematic. There was so much fog you couldn’t see a thing. But it was a huge deal for me. And I got to eat my last piece of chocolate.”"

From there you can work on anything: healthcare, policy, human rights.’   So when I returned home, I began to study for the LSAT.

I’ve arranged meetings with twenty-five different attorneys to ‘better understand the field.’  And I’m always hoping to say the right words to catch their attention.  It’s poor form to say: ‘I need a job.’   But at the end of every meeting, I always ask: ‘Do you know any opportunities that I should be pursuing?’  And the answer is always ‘no.’  I do have a job right now, and I work hard at it, but it’s mainly reviewing records and writing letters.  It’s not the path I wanted to be on.  And the longer you work in another field, the harder it can be to transition.  I’ve always wanted to make an impact.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg is my idol.  And I worked hard on this.  I studied my ass off, I was valedictorian, I got into a great school, and got great scholarship money.  I’ve had a job since I was sixteen.

    "content":"“We’d been married for four years.  We had two young daughters.  Everything seemed normal.  He never stayed out late.  He was a police officer, but he was always home on weekends.  And we had a robust sex life.  He was my best friend.  Sometimes we’d stay up all night talking-- no TV, just talking.  Then one morning I tried printing something out on our office computer, and it just kept printing out the same page.  It was a picture of his naked body, combined with the profile page for a gay website.  He said it was nothing.  Only porn.  Then a few months later I found the same picture in the ‘unsent messages’ folder of our Outlook account.  He’d been trying to send it to a transgender woman named Gabby.  That’s when I went through his Internet history and found thousands of jpegs of transgender porn.  He denied being gay.  He said it was nothing but a porn addiction.  But then a few weeks later I was reviewing our credit card statement, and saw that he’d gotten tested for HIV.  The next day he brought me to church.  He sat me down with the pastor.  And he confessed that he’d been having sex with transgender prostitutes throughout our marriage.  We didn’t immediately divorce.  I tried to make it work for our daughters.  He tried going to an addiction treatment center at Johns Hopkins.  But I felt like I was married to a stranger.  It drove me to the edge.  On Super Bowl Sunday of that year, I was sitting in my bed, crying, heavily medicated, when I heard him on the phone downstairs.  He was laughing like he didn’t have a care in the world.  That night I checked his phone, and saw that he’d been talking to Gabby.  He’d been texting her every day for months.  The last one said: ‘My wife is getting suspicious.’  That’s when I kicked him out of the house.  I haven’t spoken to him in years.  He does call my daughters a couple times per week.  I just tell them that things between Mommy and Daddy didn’t work out.  He seems to be doing fine.  He has a new family now.  And he’s a minister.”",

    "content":"“My dad brought me here at the age of seven. My mom stayed back in Jamaica, so it was just me and him. He was very strict. It was cultural, mostly. He’d served in the military back home.  So he controlled all areas of my life-- school, sports, socializing. Nothing was ever enough for him: not the first place medals, not the honor roll, nothing.  He tried hard to break me down. He’d wake me up at 3 AM to go running. He’d make me kneel on the floor all night. And he’d never let me speak back. He intimidated me into silence. I left the house when I turned eighteen. I got a job as a pharmacy tech.  I got my own apartment, but I still lived nearby. One day I was driving to work, and I saw him walking to the bus stop.  So I pulled over and picked him up. The ride was only ten minutes. But there was a different energy. He actually talked to me. And he let me talk back. He told me things about his life. He talked about how stressed he felt.  Things got better after that day. I’d occasionally drop by the house. I introduced him to my girlfriend. He’d tell jokes and laugh. We were beginning to form a relationship. On the morning he died, I actually drove past the crime scene without realizing it.  My phone was turned off because it’s not allowed at work. When I finally turned it on, I had several missed calls from him. Each time he left a voicemail: ‘Alex, pick up,’ ‘Alex, please come get me,’ ‘Alex, I need a ride.’ The only time he didn’t leave a voicemail was the very last call. He’d been shot in the neck while walking to the bus stop. I always wonder if the last call was while he was bleeding out. The next few months were surreal. I felt like I was sleepwalking. And I felt responsible. He’d called me for a ride and I’d been right around the corner. I ended up quitting my job.  I went to a recruiter's office. And I punished myself the same way he’d have done it: I joined the Marines.”"

She called me one day and said: ‘I don’t want you to find out by Googling your name.’  It wasn’t a huge surprise, actually.  It explained a lot of his behavior.  He promised to pay for our school—then didn’t.  He never wanted to pay child support.  He started calling less and less.  I haven’t heard from him in years.  But I have a really, really great stepdad.  I just call him Andrew.  My first memory of him was when I was ten years old.  I just thought he was a nice older guy at the New Year's Eve party.  But my mom got hammered, and the whole ride home, she kept saying: ‘Isn’t he so great?  Isn’t he so cute?’  Two years later he moved in with us.  He never tried to discipline me.  He’d leave that to my mom.  He always had the attitude of: ‘I’m not your father.’  But he was another adult in the house that I could rely on.  And I’d never had that before.  He’d cook meals for us.  And he’d really work hard on them.  And he’d drive me places.  I think 95% of my needs at the time were cooking and driving.  Even today, I could call him if I need a ride anywhere.  If he’s not able to do it himself, he’ll pay for a cab.  Or he’ll figure out another solution.  It’s the kind of attention that makes you feel like you’re deserving of someone else’s time.  He’s far from perfect.  He works too much.  He snores.  He doesn’t do his laundry.  But when I think of the qualities of a good man, or dad, or just person—Andrew’s got them.”"

I worked as a commercial real estate broker.  But at the age of 42 I started drinking again.  At first I was just entertaining clients, but I began to flood into bad habits.  I was attracted to the underbelly of the city.  One night a prostitute in Brooklyn offered me a hit of crack, and I accepted.  Immediately I began to use against my will.  That year a $250,000 bonus was dumped into my bank account.  I did manage to pay the bills for the house, but all the rest went to smoking.  I became a horrible employee.  My family thought I was going to work every day, but I spent all my time bouncing between hotels and crack houses in Brooklyn.  My teenage son would leave me voicemail after voicemail, begging me to come home.  It was an ugly, dark, scary place.  I hit rock bottom in 2013.  One night I was having an orgy with two girls and a dealer, and my heart seized up.  I just kept hitting the crack, hoping for a heart attack.  I went to rehab on Christmas Day that year.  I had a few relapses, but I’ve been clean for four years now.  Recently I was taking some clients to a restaurant in Brooklyn, and as soon as I got out of the car, I noticed a woman coming toward me.  It was the girl who’d gotten me started.  She looked like Rihanna when I met her.  But now she looked horrible.  Her body had shrunk down to nothing.  Instantly I told her: ‘T, I have no money.’  But she spent fifteen minutes begging me and offering sex.  I told her that I couldn’t help her.  I felt horrible, but I couldn’t risk my own recovery by getting involved.   I remember that when we used to smoke, she’d always say: ‘Someday I’ll get clean, someday.’  But she never had a chance.  At the end of every night I could drive away.  I could go back to my phony fucking life in suburbia.  I could disconnect.  And when I decided to get clean, my neighbors and friends from the good side of life circled the wagons to help me.  But she had nowhere to go.  She had no one to help.  She lived in the insanity.”",

But we never cared about that stuff because we had a creek behind our house, and we didn’t have money for movies anyway.  My mother raised seven of us on her own.  She was caring, but not exactly the ‘lovey-dovey’ type.  She never used a switch on us, but she loved to use an example.  Every action in our house had an equal and opposite reaction.  In 1964 the World’s Fair came to town, and my school band was invited to give a concert for the governor.  My mother gave me money to take my uniform to the cleaners.  But on the day of the fair, I was on punishment.  And she never let me go.  The day before she died I visited her in the hospital, and I told her: ‘I’m still mad at you for not letting me go to the World’s Fair.’  She didn’t answer me, but she had this gleam in her eye that said: ‘You learned your lesson.’  And she’s right.  Those examples made me the man I am today.  I’ve literally done everything I wanted to do as a kid.  I may not have been to the World’s Fair, but I’ve been to Ghana.  I’ve been to the Caribbean.  I’ve travelled all over the world.” (1/3)",

I was waiting for my train at the 125th Street Station, and I noticed so much animosity.  It didn’t feel like a sharing and caring kind of place.  So I said to myself: ‘I’m going to help change the pace.’  I went to visit my high school chorus teacher-- Mr. Williams, and I told him: ‘I want to sing on 125th Street.’  He thought it was great idea.  He said that he’d done the same thing when he was my age.  Together we found a cheap amp and microphone, and I gave it a try.  My first day was a Tuesday.  I stood on the downtown platform.  I’d never sung in public before.  I was so nervous that I couldn’t find my voice.  I wasn’t exactly mute, but I wasn’t fully singing either.  Then an old lady came up to me.  I’m pretty sure she was an angel.  She told me: ‘Sing Whitney Houston.’  Then she stood there, and kept saying: ‘Louder, louder, louder,’ until I was singing full volume.  I made $60 that day.  And I got so much positive feedback.  Now I’m singing four days a week and making enough to provide for me and my daughter.  And I get so much love.  So much love.  So, so much love.\"",

I was in acting school, and there was so much pressure put on our senior year showcase.  The pill gave me so much energy.  I remember making a seven-page spreadsheet of all the agents in New York, including their address, specialty, and preferred method of contact.  Adderall gave me an ‘in’ to caring.    It’s so hard to be an actor in New York.  You have to want it so badly.  But I’d always struggled with depression and lack of motivation.  I thought I’d finally found the solution.  I just went to the psychiatrist and told them I needed a prescription.  It was so easy to get.  It went from every week, to every other day, to every day.  I built my life around it.  It got to the point where I’d never leave the house or coffee shop.  I wasn’t even getting real work done.  I was just doing random shit.  I’d write songs, tinker with my website, and send random messages to people I hardly knew.  I wasn’t sleeping.  I hardly ate.  And the moment I stopped taking the pill, I’d feel disgusting.  I was destroying my body.  But the thing about Adderall is-- if you don’t tell anyone, nobody really knows.  From the outside it just looks like you’re motivated and working hard.  But you’re horribly addicted.  You look like you.  But it’s not really you.”",

I tried jumping into the conversation a few times, but it seemed like everyone was talking to each other more.  Eventually they peeled off, and I just walked up and down the street alone.  That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the semester.  It was the longest four months of my life.  It seemed like everyone was making friends except me.  Or they’d already formed groups and weren’t accepting new people.  I kept hearing other kids making plans after class, and it was a reminder that other people were making connections that I couldn’t.  I spent most of my free time alone in my room.  I’d sleep through entire weekends.  I felt like a broken social person.  Recently I transferred to a school closer to home, and it’s been much better.  There were a few familiar faces, which helped.

Where I grew up, not too many people go to college out of state.  So when I got accepted into West Point, I assumed that I’d continue to succeed.  But I finished my first semester with a 2.5 GPA.  Not only was I barely surviving, but I felt like I was trying as hard as I could.  I started thinking: ‘Am I dumb?  Can I even do this?’  My second semester I had a physics teacher named Major Bowen.  He was honest with me about my faults.  He told me that I needed to get more sleep.  And that I had poor time management skills.  But he also told me some nice stuff.  He said that I was a good student to have in class.  And that I was definitely smart enough to succeed.  It’s nice to hear that stuff when you’re surrounded by so many naturally talented people.  Major Bowen showed me ways to become more efficient.  I started using calendars.  I started studying in groups.  I began tutoring people in calculus, because teaching is the best way to really learn a subject.  Six weeks into the second semester I got my first test back, and it was an ‘A.’  It was a ’90,’ but it was an ‘A.’  It was like: ‘Oh, wow.  I can do this.’”",

That’s when I learned about Crohn’s disease, which basically means that I have ulcerations in my intestine.  It’s pretty brutal.  Constant pain.  Sometimes I can’t get out of bed.  Other times I throw up blood.  Once I got so desperate that I tried to heal myself with a thirty-five day water fast.  It didn’t work, and by the end I was down to 95 lbs.  I’ve gone through a lot of depression because of the pain.  Honestly, if it wasn’t for my wife and kids, I might have ended it by now. It’s heartbreaking for my wife to see me go through it.  And it’s heartbreaking for me to put her through it.  I feel like I’m holding her back.  She’s so adventurous.  She loves dancing, and traveling, and going out, and exploring.  And I can’t do any of that.  We took a three-day trip to the mountains in Seattle and I spent the entire time in tears on the couch.  Same thing happened when we took the kids to Disneyland.  I just hate being the sick husband.  She has to pick up so much of the slack.  But we’ve been to marital counseling.  And I’ve told her all of this.  And she swears that she wouldn’t change a thing.

I volunteered to be the representative for my housing unit.  And toward the end of the meeting, the warden asked if anyone had questions or concerns.  The NBA finals were going on at the time.  So I raised my hand and asked: ‘If the Cavs force a game seven, can we keep the TV on past lock up time?’  And she agreed.  She agreed in front of everyone.  So when game seven came around, all of us were excited.  We gathered around the TV in the dayroom to watch the game.  But right as the second quarter was starting, the television clicked off.  The CO came down and tried to kick everybody out.  I told her the warden gave us permission, but she said it didn’t matter. And that’s when things began to go downhill.  We refused to leave.  The CO went behind a protected gate and pulled the silent alarm.  We grabbed all the tables and chairs and stacked them up against the door.  We covered the floor in shampoo and water.  The security team came back with riot gear and huge cans of pepper spray, but we kept the door closed for over two hours.  When they finally got inside, they were slipping all over the place.  We just laid down on the floor and put our hands behind our back.  I was given thirty days in solitary confinement.  But I had to do the right thing.  Women are allowed to vote because some woman wanted to vote.  The Civil Rights Movement started because Rosa Parks didn’t want to get out of her seat.

Things were so bad that my dad got custody of us when I was five, but it wasn’t much better with him.  He always chose his girlfriends over us.  We moved around a lot.  During this time my mom would send me drunk texts.  She’d call me a horrible daughter and accuse me of forsaking her.  My whole childhood was unstable.  And I always craved stability.  The more I saw the relationships that my parents had with other people, the more I wanted to be a part of it.  I moved back in with my mother last year.  I helped her pay the bills.  I made sure she had food on the table.  I woke her up in the morning to go for job interviews.  It was awful.  She was drunk all the time.  But I knew that she needed me, and that gave me some sort of purpose.  I don’t really know what I’m doing with my life.  Or who I am.  Or what I want to be.  But if someone is dependent on me, then at least it’s a reason to stick around.  All my relationships have been like that.  I’m drawn to people who are insecure.  Who need to be wanted.  And then I do things to make them feel alone so they rely on me even more.  And if they ever try to pull away, I use my feelings to make them feel guilty.  It’s pretty toxic behavior.

My friends and I were going to a golf tournament the next morning, so we wanted to get some sleep.  But at the last minute we decided to grab a quick drink.  My buddies were doing their thing, so I decided to take a lap around the bar.  And I noticed one girl that was just glowing.  I’m pretty sure that she was sitting right under one of the bar lights.  I just had to go for it.  I walked right up to her.  I said something like: ‘I want to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you.”  After that I was grasping at straws.  I kept trying to find a common denominator.  But the best I could come up with was that she was in the same sorority as my friend’s cousin.  Somehow we ended up talking for the next fifteen minutes. The bar was so loud that we had to lean in to talk to each other.  At one point we actually touched cheeks.  And my buddies are gonna tear me apart for this, but I just remember thinking that she had the softest face.  I gave her my number at the end of the conversation.  I wasn’t really expecting to hear from her.  But the next day she told her mom the story, and her mom said: ‘Give him a call.  You don’t have to marry him.’”"

They visited my school in third grade.  And I guess they saw something in me, because they provided two free ballet classes per week.  I didn’t really like it at first.  But one night I went to see The Nutcracker, and it inspired me to become a dancer.  I enrolled in a serious ballet school, and by the age of thirteen I was dancing five days a week.  Then six days a week.  The school started to get really competitive as we got older.  Everybody wanted to be a soloist.   Kids would come to the school from all over the world.  Some of them were ‘bunheads.’  All they did was dance and watch tapes.  But most of us were more balanced.  Ballet is extremely rigid, so if you have the opportunity to have fun, you take it.  I started drinking a lot.  And doing a lot of drugs.  It was hard to hide.  I’d come to class late and tired.  I ended up dropping out of regular high school.  The dance school never approved of that decision, but I always hated studying.  Personally I don’t think I ever lost my edge.  I was just driven in ballet and partying at the same time.  They kicked me out of the school when I turned twenty.  I knew it was coming, because that’s the age when you either go to college or join a dance company.  But neither of those were options for me, so I just quit completely.  That’s when the dancing stopped.  But the partying kept going.”",

But in my neighborhood, we opposed the government by breaking into houses and robbing people.  But in 1994 we were told: ‘Democracy is coming.  Apartheid is ending.  It’s time to learn a trade.’  So I listened.  I did everything I was supposed to do.  I’ve worked in construction for the past twenty-five years.  I started my own company.  I followed all the procedures.  But nothing has come of it.  The government always talks about empowerment.  They make a big show of letting small businesses compete for contracts.  But the jobs always get awarded to the same few people.  If the government gave me work, it would empower me.  Then I could empower other people.  I could hire employees and teach them plumbing, and carpentry, and cabinets.  I could purchase a brick making machine, and hire women to mix cement.  But right now I can’t even afford a printer for my office.  Everything is hand to mouth.  I had high hopes when apartheid ended.  But I’ve been building houses for twenty-five years, and I’m still living in a shack.”",

I felt like my skin was too dark and my build was too muscular.  Other kids were telling me that I looked like a boy.  I got bullied a lot.  I didn’t have any friends.  I began to feel depressed.  Then one weekend I got invited to a party at a boy’s house.  I was excited to go.  But when I got there, it was nothing but drunk people.  Everyone was passing around a joint.  And when it got to me, the boy said: ‘Trust me, you’ll love it.’  So I tried it.  And I did love it.  Next thing you know, I was going out every weekend.  I started drinking heavily.  I was high all the time.  My grades began to drop.  But I was also getting cooler.  I was never alone anymore.  I was hanging out with popular people.  We all hyped each other up, so it was easy to ignore the consequences of our behavior.  But whenever I was alone again, I felt like I didn’t know myself anymore.  I was heading down the wrong path.  That’s not how I was brought up.  So I had to get conscious.  I had to be honest about what brings me happiness: writing poetry, reading books, and sometimes being alone.  I backed away from the party lifestyle.  I became more selfish with my time.  The other night I ran into a few of my old friends, and they were a little mad because I hadn’t been around.  They said I was acting like I was above it all.  But that’s not the case.  I’m just at a different stage of my life.”",

In high school I went on a humanitarian mission to provide health and education for a village in Senegal.  There was no water.  There was no electricity.  We visited a small orphanage where the children had to beg for their food every day.  They had no choice, because if they came back with nothing, they didn’t eat.  I cried myself to sleep that night.  And when I returned to France, I felt guilty for everything: for living where I live, for having a family, for growing up in a rich country with education and healthcare.  I didn’t tell many people about my experience.  I didn’t want it to seem like a trophy.  And I was aware of the irony because France colonized Senegal.  But that trip opened my eyes to the opportunities I’d been taking for granted.  It made me appreciate the choices that I have in life.  And since those choices are a privilege, I want to use them to help other people.”"

And I got hooked.  My boyfriend didn’t like it.  He thought it made me less desirable.  But the worse our relationship got, the more I focused on working out.  It just felt so great to be recognized for something.  I was really, really good at it.  And the bodybuilding community is so great.  They’re some of the least judgmental people because they’re used to being judged all the time.  For the first few years I was really self-conscious about my body.  But I’ve gotten to the point where the small comments don’t really bother me anymore: ‘ew,’ gross,’ ‘disgusting’-- things like that.  I can usually block people out if they can’t type more than a sentence.   But occasionally the criticism sinks in.  It still hurts when people question my gender.  Or my sexuality.  And I’ve had some awkward Tinder dates.  The last guy said: ‘Holy fuck, you’re bigger than I thought you’d be.’  But despite all this, I’ve gotten comfortable in my own skin.  I actually feel more feminine now than I did growing up.  I was always skinny.  I never had breasts.  I didn’t ever feel like a natural woman.  But what is natural?  Is make-up natural?  Or botox?  Or fillers?  Or breast implants?  All of us are flawed.  My mask might be different than other people, but we all hide behind something.  I just hide behind my muscles.”",

It can be difficult for start-ups to get funding in South Africa, so I’m trying to build a platform that connects investors and entrepreneurs.  I’ve been working on it full time for about a year now.  But the idea hasn’t taken off as quickly as I’d hoped.   Don’t get me wrong-- I’m still on the grind.  I’m still having meetings and trying to put together deals.  I’m telling myself that no matter what, I’m going to figure this out.  But if I’m being absolutely honest with you, it’s not looking promising.  I’ve got about two or three months of runway left.  The bank has been calling me every day because of the credit card.  And my car just broke down, which will probably eat up twenty percent of my remaining reserves.  My options are running out.  It’s a lot of pressure, but I’m trying to focus on the bright side.  I made it a whole year.   We built the initial platform and had a few users.  And I’ve moved forward as a person.  I’ve gained a lot of new insights.  I’ve grown my network.  Experienced people have told me that I’m working on an important problem.  And that validation means more than money.  So even if this particular business fails, I’ll try again.  But next time I’ll come back at a better angle.”",

The police aren’t doing anything, so we’re forced to take matters into our own hands.  Recently one of my customers had his car broken into.  While I was repairing his shoe, we heard glass shatter.

I made him call his brothers and tell them he was about to be killed.  Sure enough, they brought back the laptop.  So I let him go.

I’d have to drop out for a few weeks, and since flying involves so much muscle memory, it would take me a while to get back on track.  So one day I bought a stack of magazines and newspapers.  I went through every page and cut out the advertisements.  Then I opened my pantry and wrote down every brand I could find.  I sent all of them letters, asking for help.  Almost everyone said ‘no.’  But I did receive an amount from a grocery store called Pick-n-Pay.  And Breitling sent me a brand new watch to raffle.  That was a huge break.  I sold six hundred raffle tickets.  Things were going so well.  African Pilot Magazine promoted the raffle for free.  A man from Australia bought 100 tickets.  But then I got a letter from the Lottery Board ordering me to end my raffle.  They said it was illegal.  I tried to explain that I was raising money for my education, but they didn’t care.  I was so disappointed.  I’d have to sit out another year of flight school.  But when I called everyone to explain the situation, nobody would accept their money back.  They told me to keep it!  It was enough to keep me in the air for months.  Then around Christmas that year, one of my mentors invited me to eat lunch at the airport.  When I stepped out of the car, everyone who had ever helped me was there.  They all started clapping.  And somebody handed me the phone.  A person on the other end said: ‘You’re live on 94.7, and we’re going to pay for your entire education!’  That was nearly four years ago.  I just got my license last week.  My plan is to fly for South African Airlines, but first I want to do some teaching.  I want to visit schools in black neighborhoods.  I want all the kids to see what an African female pilot looks like.”",
